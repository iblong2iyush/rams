{"name":"RAMS","tagline":"RFID Attendance Management System","body":"### Birth\r\nThe object of RFID used in RAMS is to carry data in swipe cards embedded in College ID Cards and to retrieve data, by machine-readable means at a suitable time and place to satisfy particular application requirements.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nConventionally, the teachers have to take the attendance of students manually which led to wastage of time and energy which otherwise could be redirected to more productive results. RAMS provides us with the facility to automate the process of attendance reports via SMS/E-Mail and monthly alerts to employees (issuance of salaries) and intraday alerts to parents (missed classes by wards).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nLike two hands of Modern Efficient Man, the flexibility and feasibility of RAMS allows the Admin to export data (attendance, marks, hierarchy, etc) to many possible formats as well as in graphical forms like Chart and Graphs using a precise combination of Tools and Technologies working in sync to provide a comprehensive and proficient Attendance System that automates all that is necessary (Alerting, Scheduling and Updating) to make the system robust and accurate, while on the other hand RAMS offers fully featured flexibility by privileging the users(H.O.D) to add/modify assistants, faculty and students' lectures, timetables, suspension/promotion, holiday alerts broadcasting.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2011, Ayush K. Singh (@iblong2iyush) founded RAMS.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
